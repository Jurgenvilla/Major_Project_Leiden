In this work we present a statistical analysis on the occurrence rate of exoplanetary rings. Following a Monte-Carlo and analytic approach to reproduce the stellar mass IMF and the exo-planetary mass-and period-distributions, we proposed low-mass stars below $2.0 \textnormal{M}_\odot$ as those candidates with the hugest chance to harbor planets orbiting with exoplanetary rings (already formed or in the formation process). The expected number of detections lies between $100$ and $10$ for a stellar mass range between $0.1 \textnormal{M}_\odot$ and $2.0 \textnormal{M}_\odot$, out of a total number of $10\,000$ stars and exoplanets period-mass pairs simulated. Using \textit{Gaia} DR2 data we performed an analysis of the well-known OB association ScoCen (also known as Sco OB2) subdividing the region in three subgroups, \textit{Upper Scorpius}, \textit{Upper Centaurus Lupus}, and \textit{Lower Centaurus Crux}. For each subgroup its respective Hertzsprungâ€“Russell was created to pre-select stars between two isochrone models of $5 \textnormal{Myr}$ and $60 \textnormal{Myr}$, where the youngest isochrones was corrected by extinction values reported in literature. Stellar tracks where also computed probing that our final sample contains stars below $2 \textnormal{M}_\odot$ to values down to $0.1 \textnormal{M}_\odot$ which corresponds to the lower limits of the isochrone-and stellar tracks-models. However, we can go a bit further down this low limit in mass with the new \textit{Gaia} DR2 data set. The final sample of stars is cross-matched to the \textit{SuperWASP} database in order to retrieve light curves for the selected stars motivated by the light curve of J1407. A final sample of $\sim20$ candidates is proposed after inspecting the light curves as possible exoplanetary ringed systems or probable variable stars as compared to the actual light curved of J1407. Additionally, we redefined the original limits of ScoCen in galactic coordinates to be $285^\circ\leq\ell\leq360^\circ$ and $-10^\circ\leq b\leq+32^\circ$ and a parallax range of $5$ to $12$ mas and performed a selection of the young population which led to the natural overall trend and some outstanding over-densities out of the original boxes. This method allows the study of membership in associations relatively easy as a first step to lately applied kinematic method and increase the chance of studying a large sample of actual stars belonging to the association.
