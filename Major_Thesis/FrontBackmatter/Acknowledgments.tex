    It is sometimes said that scientists are unromantic, \\ that their passion to figure out robs the world of beauty and mystery. \\

    that color is the way we perceive the wavelengths of light,\\ that transparent air reflects light,

    It does no harm to the romance of the sunset to know a little bit about it.\\ \medskip}

\chapter*{Acknowledgments}

First and foremost I would like to thank my amazing supervisors, Dr. A.G.A. Brown and Dr. M.A. (Matthew) Kenworthy, who encouraged me to research in a completely different fashion, in a branch of Astronomy I had never worked on as it is the exoplanets and the Gaia mission. I am extremely grateful for all the new things they taught me in order to be a good researcher and to pave my way as a scientist.\\

To my parents, Jorge Mario Villa Mar\'in and Gladys V\'elez Mu\~noz who have trusted in me through this years, always supporting all my dreams and also now in this adventure. They have always been an important shoulder I can rely on to take every step forward on my way to be a good scientist. To all my family in Colombia and USA because this dream would have not been becoming real without their enormous help and trust in me.\\

Also, to Paula Andrea Ort\'iz Ot\'alvaro who helped me to get rapidly involved in the Dutch life-style and feel Leiden as a second home since the first day. To my fellow master Colombian friends Juan Manuel Espejo Salcedo and Andr\'es Felipe Ramos Padilla for all those good times lived inside and outside the university. For all those enriching talks which shed light when problems seemed to have no solution. Someone, who motivated me to study and to look forward, Guadalupe Ca\~nas Herrera, my little Spanish friend, thanks for all those good advises and funny times.\\

My dutch friends which helped me to feel this country as a second home, for all those good times and memories that will be forever in my mind (Michelle Willebrands, Esmee Stoop, Charlotte Brand, Lieke van Son, Marco Trueba van den Boom, Job van der Wardt, Dennis Vaendel, Lennart van Sluijs, Martijn Oei and Dirk van Dam). I would also like to dedicate this to my fellow international master friends who came here to make the same dream come true, Louis Martin, Michail Dagtzis and Pranav Kumar Mohanty. Last but not least, to Sofia Sarperi and Riccardo Mattia Baldo which I had the pleasure to meet during their Erasmus program in Leiden. To them, a big thank for all the good moments and conversations. \\

When I arrived to Leiden I thought it was going to be impossible to keep on doing the things I used to in Medell\'in. However I met a group of beautiful people who accepted me and shared all their empathy with me. To the Chileans Valeria Olivares, Pedro Salas, Pablo Castellanos, Heather Andrews, Javiera Paz, Sebasti\'an Rumie and Nicol\'as Salinas. Also to my Mexican friend Santiago Torres, my Colombian friends Lina Bayona and Diana Aranzales who always took care of me. To one person who was always there to support and encourage me, my Portuguese friend Marta Figueiredo. To Dennis Hiltrop the kindest German I have ever met, with whom I had enriching talks. To Kathy Fourment with who I had really nice talks and funny days.\\

Before coming to The Netherlands I was going through a bad time and now that I am here witnessing this dream coming true I really need to thank to my cousin Jaime Mu\~noz and his husband William Lundquist because they took care of me while in California during one of my darkest times, helping and cheering me up when needed. They always encouraged me to continue straight on the science path, being humble and never backing off.\\ 

To all the people who directly or indirectly made this first step on my way to get a master in Astronomy possible, many many thanks and I will keep on fighting until the end on my way to keep on reaching my dreams.
